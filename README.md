# AWS Cloud Resume Challenge
I have worked in IT for some time now, and since that's usually been in small business environments, I haven't had a lot of hands-on experience using cloud infrastructure.
The Cloud Resume Challenge was a great way for me to level up my skills and demonstrate fundamentals that are critical for a career in cloud computing. The project was published by Forest Brazeal.
